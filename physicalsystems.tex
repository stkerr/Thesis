\label{chapter:physicalsystems}

Physical systems present an interesting problem domain for study. In contrast to software systems,
they are subjected to multiple different factors that all require consideration during design. Physical
systems frequently must be able to cope with environmental factors such as temperature change, moisture,
or questionable power systems. 

A purely software system may be able to assume it will only receive input from a standard input and output
channel. In contrast, a physical system must be able
to account for multiple different input sources, especially input types that might not have been intended. 
A physical system might receive input directly from end users, networking devices, sensors. A physical
system could also consider environment changes as a sort of secondary, unitended input. For example,
the device's power may fluctuate, potentially changing the behavior of internal circuits. A temperature change
could cause the sensitivity of a certain component to increase or decrease, which will in turn alter the behavior
of the system. These are but a few examples of the various factors that a physical system must be properly
designed to handle and account for.
