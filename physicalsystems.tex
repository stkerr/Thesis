\label{chapter:physicalsystems}

Physical systems present an interesting problem domain for study. In contrast to software systems,
they are subjected to multiple different factors that all require consideration during design. Physical
systems frequently must be able to cope with environmental factors such as temperature change, moisture,
or questionable power systems. 

A purely software system may be able to assume it will only receive input from a standard input and output
channel. In contrast, a physical system must be able
to account for multiple different input sources, especially input types that might not have been intended. 
A physical system might receive input directly from end users, networking devices, sensors. A physical
system could also consider environment changes as a sort of secondary, unitended input. For example,
the device's power may fluctuate, potentially changing the behavior of internal circuits. A temperature change
could cause the sensitivity of a certain component to increase or decrease, which will in turn alter the behavior
of the system. These are but a few examples of the various factors that a physical system must be properly
designed to handle and account for.

\section{Typical Organization and Use Case of Physical Systems}
Physical systems are a very broad category that covers a large set of devices, applications, and use cases.
Because of this, it is difficult to discuss physical systems generically. Rather, this section details some
of the common configurations that physical systems take. The rest of the work will regard physical systems as
belonging to one of the configurations discussed.

% Standalone device (in the field)
\subsection*{Standalone Physical Systems}
One common configuration of a physical system is that of a standalone physical system. This means that the
physical system is not reliant on communicating with another physical; it is deployed and functions
independently. An example of this could be a cash register. Employees conduct transactions on the register
and

\section{Benign Considerations}
There are multiple ways that a physical system or device could fail. These failures may not necessarily have
any malicious reason behind them, but they still must be considered and evaluated during system design.
