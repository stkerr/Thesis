% Give an overview of PUF devices

\chapter{Physically Unclonable Functions}
\label{chapter:pufoverview}
It is desirable for a user to be sure that the device that he is using is authentic. However, due to the sophistication
of forgeries or possible communication tampering, a user might be suspicious that the system is the system it claims
to be. A device called a Physically Unclonable Function, or PUF, is a technology that remedies this problem.

A PUF device provides a unique challenge-response capability. That is, when two PUFS are provided the identical
challenge, they will each produce unique responses. In this way, a PUF, and the system it contains, 
can be identified by the response value it generates to a specific challenge. A more formalized definition of
this relationship is given below.

\begin{align*}
PUF_1(C) = R_1\\
PUF_2(C) = R_2\\
R_1 \neq R_2
\end{align*}



\section{Types of PUFs}
A PUF device provides this sort of relationship by leveraging the physical properties
of the materials in which it is instantiated. There are several different ways of doing
this, from measuring the distortions of reflected light to leveraging the
manufacturing inconsistencies from one chip to another.

\subsection{Ring Oscillator PUF}
A Ring Oscillator PUF is a PUF design that utilizes a circuit called a Ring 
Oscillator (RO). An RO is an odd number of inverter gates tied together. Because
there are an odd number of gates, this will produce a continuously changing,
or oscillating, signal.

\end{figure}

Depending on the number of inverter gates being used
as well as the propogation delay of every indiviudal inverter, the output
frequency of one RO may be different from another RO. In Figure ~\ref{fig:ro},
this output signal corresponds to the signal marked $Q$.

When used as part of a PUF, the unique behavior of an RO will be examined.
Consider again the 3 stage RO as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:ro}. All three
inverter gates are assumed to have the same propogation delay and the
interconnecting wires are assumed to impose a neglible delay. However, in
an actual instationtion of an RO, these assumptions are invalid. All three inverters
should have the same propogation delay, but, due to uncontrollable manufacturing
inconsistencies and tolerances, they do not. In a similar vein, the interconnecting
wires will also impose a non-zero delay time in signal propogation. Both of these
factors will combine so that even if two ROs are produced on the same 
manufacturing line, they will generate a slightly different output frequency.

The slightly different output frequenices of two ring oscillators forms the basis
of randomness for the Ring Oscillator PUF. Because the output frequencies of the
ROs cannot be predicted, their actual frequency at runtime gives a way to uniquely
identify the individual PUF that contains them. In Figure ~\ref{fig:ropuf}, a more
detailed diagram of a PUF based off of ring oscillators is presented.
