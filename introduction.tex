% Discuss the structure of the thesis
The rest of the thesis is structured as followed. Chapter ~\ref{chapter:physicalsystems} describes physical systems and
their nature, including several of the difficulties that are involved with them. Chapter ~\ref{chapter:cryptographyoverview}
provides some of the necessary cryptography background needed. Chapter ~\ref{chapter:pufoverview} introduces
PUF technology and creates an inital connection to physical systems. Chapter ~\ref{chapter:applications} describes several
applications of PUF technology as it incorporated into physical systems. These applications each demonstrate the use of PUF
as a way of resolving the issues facing physical systems. Chapter ~\ref{chapter:conclusion} draws final conclusions and presents
closing thoughts.
